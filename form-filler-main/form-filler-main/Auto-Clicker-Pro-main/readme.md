# Auto Clicker & Form Filler Pro 🚀

An advanced, user-friendly Chrome extension built for automated form filling and click sequences. It supports filling repeated forms with identical fixed information (Name, Email, Address, Option Selections) while dynamically rotating through unique paragraphs loaded from a `.txt` file (consuming one paragraph per rotation), pasting from the system clipboard, and executing smart color and text condition branches.

---

## ✨ Main Features

### 1. 📄 Dynamic Paragraph Queue (from TXT)
- **1 Paragraph Per Rotation:** On every form submission or rotation loop, the next paragraph from your TXT file is automatically filled into your chosen text box.
- **Auto-Removal / Consumption:** Once a paragraph is used in a rotation, it is consumed and removed from the active queue.
- **Next-Up Live Preview:** Always see which paragraph is queued up for the next rotation, complete with character counts.
- **Save / Export Remaining TXT:** Download the remaining unused paragraphs anytime as an updated `.txt` file with one click!
- **Flexible Import:** Load a `.txt` file via file picker or paste text directly (with support for blank lines or single line paragraph delimiters).

### 2. 📋 Clipboard Pasting Step
- **System Clipboard Injection:** Designate any field as a **📋 Paste Clipboard** step.
- During playback, the extension automatically reads the current system clipboard content and pastes it into the field, dispatching native reactive form events.
- Easy one-click toggle in the step list or via the on-page floating pill while recording.

### 3. 🔽 Dropdown & Option Box Selection
- **Custom Dropdowns:** Record clicking the dropdown/select box trigger to open options, and then click on your desired option inside. During playback, the extension automatically waits for the dropdown menu to open and clicks the option item.
- **Native `<select>` Elements:** Automatically detects and records option changes on standard HTML `<select>` tags by option text, value, and index.
- **Framework Compatibility:** Dispatches native input, change, pointerdown, and click events compatible with React, Vue, Angular, and vanilla web forms.

### 4. 🔀 Smart Mode: Area Selection & Condition Branches
- **Area Selection:** Click **Area** to draw a custom rectangular overlay on any webpage and save its coordinates.
- **Color Condition:** Detect if a specific color appears within an area on the page, and execute separate click sequences for the **Match** branch vs the **No-Match** branch.
- **Text Condition:** Detect if specific text appears in an area, running different click branches based on the result.
- **Quick Hotkeys During Recording:**
  - `C` or `c`: Start Color Condition flow
  - `T` or `t`: Start Text Condition flow
  - `Esc`: Finish recording or complete branch

### 5. ✍️ Static Form Fields with Same Info
- **Fill Static Fields:** Fill unchanging fields (e.g., Name, Email, Phone, Company, Checkboxes) across every rotation.
- **One-Click Field Designation:** In the popup step list (or on the web page), easily cycle between **📄 Dynamic Para**, **✍️ Static Text**, and **📋 Clipboard Paste**.

### 6. ⚡ Sequence & Looping Controls
- **Match TXT Count:** Click **⚡ Match TXT** to instantly set the rotation loop count to the exact number of remaining paragraphs.
- **Custom Delays & Rotation Delay:** Set millisecond delays before individual steps, plus a configurable delay between rotations (to allow form submissions to process).
- **Step Testing & Reordering:** Move steps up (▲) or down (▼) to adjust execution order, and test any single step on the live page with ▶.
